						<b>Last Updated: May 8, 2022</b><br>
						At Saferide Technologies our mission is to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation, providing a platform to help you get from point A to point B. To do that, we need to collect, use, and share some of your personal information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand how Saferide Technologies does that and how to exercise the choices and rights you have in your information.<br><br>

						<b>1.0 The Scope of This Policy</b><br>
						This policy applies to all Saferide Technologies users, including Riders and Drivers (including Driver applicants), and to all Saferide Technologies platforms and services, including our apps, websites, features, and other services (collectively, the “Saferide Technologies Platform”). Please remember that your use of the Saferide Technologies Platform is also subject to our Terms of Service.<br><br>

						<b>2.0 The Information We Collect</b><br>
						When you use the Saferide Technologies Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like third-party services, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with other information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:<br><br>

						<b>A. Information You Provide to Us</b><br>
						Account Registration. When you create an account with Saferide Technologies, we collect the information you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, and payment information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your Rider profile, like your photo or saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences (such as your preferred pronouns).<br><br>

						Driver Information. If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social security number), driver’s license information, vehicle information, and car insurance information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing numbers, and tax information. Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for additional business license or permit information or other information to manage driving and programs relevant to that location. We may need additional information from you at some point after you become a Driver, including information to confirm your identity (like a photo).<br><br>

						Ratings and Feedback. When you rate and provide feedback about Riders or Drivers, we collect all of the information you provide in your feedback.<br><br>

						Communications. When you contact us or we contact you, we collect any information that you provide, including the contents of the messages or attachments you send us.<br><br>

						<b>B. Information We Collect When You Use the Saferide Technologies Platform</b><br>
						Location Information. Great rides start with an easy and accurate pickup. The Saferide Technologies Platform collects location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently depending on your Saferide Technologies app settings and device permissions as well as whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver:<br><br>

						Riders: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the Saferide Technologies app, including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until it ends. Saferide Technologies also tracks the precise location of scooters and e-bikes at all times.<br><br>

						Drivers: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the app, including while the app is running in the background when it is in driver mode. We also collect precise location for a limited time after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no longer active.
						Usage Information. We collect information about your use of the Saferide Technologies Platform, including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code. We also collect information about your interactions with the Saferide Technologies Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.<br><br>

						Device Information. We collect information about the devices you use to access the Saferide Technologies Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a Driver, we also collect mobile sensor data from your device (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data).<br><br>

						Communications Between Riders and Drivers. We work with a third party to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and Drivers without sharing either party’s actual phone number with the other. But while we use a third party to provide the communication service, we collect information about these communications, including the participants’ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of SMS messages. For security purposes, we may also monitor or record the contents of phone calls made through the Saferide Technologies Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call begins.<br><br>

						Address Book Contacts. You may set your device permissions to grant Saferide Technologies access to your contact lists and direct Saferide Technologies to access your contact list, for example to help you refer friends to Saferide Technologies. If you do this, we will access and store the names and contact information of the people in your address book.
						Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies. We collect information through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels, data analytics tools like Google Analytics, SDKs, and other third-party technologies to understand how you navigate through the Saferide Technologies Platform and interact with Saferide Technologies advertisements, to make your Saferide Technologies experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use the Saferide Technologies Platform. You should consult your web browser(s) to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may miss out on certain features of the Saferide Technologies Platform.<br><br>

						<b>C. Information We Collect from Third Parties</b><br>
						Third-Party Services. Third-party services provide us with information needed for core aspects of the Saferide Technologies Platform, as well as for additional services, programs, loyalty benefits, and promotions that can enhance your Saferide Technologies experience. These third-party services include background check providers, insurance partners, financial service providers, marketing providers, and other businesses. We obtain the following information about you from these third-party services:<br><br>

						<b>4. How We Share Your Information</b><br>
						We do not sell your personal information. To make the Saferide Technologies Platform work, we may need to share your personal information with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains when and why we share your information.<br><br>

						<b>A. Sharing Between Saferide Technologies Users</b><br>
						Riders and Drivers.
						Rider information shared with Driver: Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the Driver the Rider’s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider’s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Saferide Technologies app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider’s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)<br><br>

						Driver information shared with Rider: Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver’s Saferide Technologies profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver).<br><br>

						Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users. If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your consent.<br><br>

						Shared Ride Riders. When Riders use a Saferide Technologies Shared ride, we share each Rider’s name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.<br><br>

						Rides Requested or Paid For by Others. Some rides you take may be requested or paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Saferide Technologies Business Profile account, a code or coupon, a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government), or a corporate credit card linked to another account, or another user otherwise requests or pays for a ride for you, we may share some or all of your ride details with that other party, including the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.<br><br>

						Referral Programs. If you refer someone to the Saferide Technologies Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the Saferide Technologies Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the Saferide Technologies Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive such information.<br><br>

						<b>B. Sharing With Third-Party Service Providers for Business Purposes</b><br>

This means we keep your profile information for as long as you maintain an account. We retain transactional information such as rides and payments for at least seven years to ensure we can perform legitimate business functions, such as accounting for tax obligations. If you request account deletion, we will delete your information as set forth in the “Deleting Your Account” section below.<br><br>

						Do Not Track.

The Saferide Technologies Platform does not currently support Do Not Track requests at this time.<br><br>

						Deleting Your Account. If you would like to delete your Saferide Technologies account, please visit our privacy homepage. In some cases, we will be unable to delete your account, such as if there is an issue with your account related to trust, safety, or fraud.

For example, we may retain your information to resolve open insurance claims, or we may be obligated to retain your information as part of an open legal claim. When we retain such data, we do so in ways designed to prevent its use for other purposes.<br><br>
